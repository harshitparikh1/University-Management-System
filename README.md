## Why this Management system?

Universities must keep track of a large data set consisting of details from students, staff, student records, and scheduling. 
Manually managing and documenting this type of data on excel sheets can lead to major issues with security, redundancy, and consistency. 

## What's the solution?

To solve this problem, we implement a relational database system, where we improve collaboration and engagement across affiliate locations and departments, manage complex student records more efficiently, integrate and automate mapping new records to the correct table, and gain better insight and transparency for regulatory compliance.
